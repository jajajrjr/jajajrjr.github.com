[Darkside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkside_(band)) was a band from 2011-2014 with **[Nicolas Jaar](http://www.nicolasjaar.net/)** and **[Dave Harrington](http://harringtone.com/)**. A band with a laptop musician and a guitarist, Darkside created some great tracks and could improvise parts of their sets in ways that blended signature songs with interesting sonic explorations. The band is currently on hiatus but hopefully Jaar's and Harrington's schedules will allow them to revisit Darkside. Below is a show from NYC.
