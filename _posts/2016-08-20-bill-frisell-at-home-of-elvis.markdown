I stumbled upon a really great video of Bill Frisell playing at Elvis's home.  

> Bill Frisell visited 1034 Audubon Drive on a snowy night in February of 2015 captivating the audience with his incomparable skill. During this episode, Frisell plays to the heartstrings of everyone in the room, talks about his experiences, and mentions the profound affects he feels being in Elvis' home.
