While Jaja Jr. jr. was created a little while back, we've yet to hard-launch the label and/or the website. 

Jaja Jr. jr. will be bringing you new music from Brooklyn and Rochester, NY. Currently, [Friday in America][fia] and [the Mean Jean Oaks][mjo] are both in the recording phase of new albums. So in 2016 we look forward to listening to those records. Also, we're gearing up for some new PilotSuits. sessions around 2016. 

As for now, enjoy this track from our good friends [Medeski, Martin & Wood](http://mmw.net).
