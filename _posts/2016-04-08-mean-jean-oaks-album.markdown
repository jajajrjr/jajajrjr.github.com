<h3>About:</h3>
<p>The Mean Jean Oaks began recording their self-titled debut late summer 2015. From their  Williamsburg, Brooklyn practice space, over a period of three months, the Oaks crew tried to capture the raw energy of their live show and experimental jam sessions while enduring faulty microphones, bleed from bands down the hall and far-out/far-ranging erudite discussions that seemed to coalesce from the ether. The album is more song focused than the initial free-form improvisation of the Mean Jean Oaks' halycon beginnings and it marks the first full release of a shapeshifting band that began in a Greenpoint basement and has absorbed lineups as large as seven musicians to the current lineup as a three-piece. While concise songs populate the A-side of the album and provide a launching-off point, the B-side ranges from the avant-garde, the lurching, loud and dark to schizophrenic and chaotic, to the swamp-like anthem of the most ragtag basement of the modern-era, ending with an ambient, remixed and randomly re-pieced sonic experiment inspired by the low-priced Black Label beer served at the bands's local haunt.</p>
